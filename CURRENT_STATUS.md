## Frozen User Story Inventory

| Domain | Parent | Generated Stories | Total | Freeze date |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Offering | 1 | 7 | 8 | 2026-07-22 |
| Discovery | 1 | 10 | 11 | 2026-07-24 |

| Business | 1 | 7 | 8 | 2026-07-25 |
| Platform | 1 | 10 | 11 | 2026-07-25 |
| **Total** | **6** | **50** | **56** | — |

## Reconciliation Outcome

- Frozen Offering, Discovery, Identity, Decision, and Business package files were restored without rewriting their authoritative content.
- The exact Approved Platform Story package was reconciled to the explicit Owner Freeze decision by changing only Story lifecycle metadata from `Approved` to `Frozen`; versions remain `1.0`, dates remain `2026-07-25`, and Delivery Status remains `Not Started`.
- Frozen PRD and UX sources contained in the audit authority packages replaced the stale GitHub copies.
- `UX-0009-decision-flow.md`, ADR-0006–ADR-0009, and all five non-Offering Feature Registries were restored.
- No Feature, Capability, PRD behaviour, UX behaviour, Story behaviour, or Delivery Status was created or changed by repository reconciliation.
- Offering Capability Architecture v2.0 completed Owner Approval and separate Owner Freeze on 2026-07-25, closing the authoritative capability-home gap for F06 and F07.

## Remaining Work

1. Close the Engineering Constitution review record.
2. Complete the Marketplace Bible v1.0 repository freeze gate.
3. Start software architecture and implementation planning only after the freeze gate passes.

## Known Boundaries

- Non-blocking audit observations were not silently applied to Frozen Story content.
- `UX-0007 Messaging` is retained as historical Draft v0.2 outside the Frozen V1 baseline and is not required by any validated V1 Feature chain.
- Platform Parent and Generated Story lifecycle metadata now carries the missing Freeze evidence for the already-authorized 2026-07-25 Owner Freeze; Story behaviour and Delivery Status are unchanged.
- No implementation, API, database, infrastructure, or code decision is inferred from documentation reconciliation.
